# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of Task Manager Dapp where the tasks can be created, assigned to employees in the list already declared. Further the operations like updateTitle, UpdateEmployeeName can be perfomred. The tasks can be transferred from one state to another. This project uses the web3React.js library. Please see the Web3 practice updated pdf file for connecting to metamask using Web3React.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
